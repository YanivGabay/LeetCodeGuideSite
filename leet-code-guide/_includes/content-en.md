## üíª How to Interact with the Platform - Coding Area Notes

### üñ•Ô∏è Examples in C++ and Python

I will demonstrate how to use the coding area with **C++** and **Python**. Feel free to contribute examples in other languages!

---

### üî∑ C++

#### üìù Function Signature Example

If you select the question [Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum), you'll see the following function signature:

![Coding Area]({{/assets/image-22.png| relative_url}})

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        // Write your solution here
        // No need for main function, includes, or namespace std
    }
};
```

**Explanation:**
- **Object-Oriented:** The function is part of a class.
- **Simplified Setup:** No need to write `main()`, include statements, or use namespaces.

#### üõ†Ô∏è Running Locally (C++)

To run the code in your local environment:

1. **Create `main.cpp`:**

    ```cpp
    // In local environment, we need to include the libraries
    #include <vector>
    #include <iostream>
    
    // Add your using statements
    using std::vector;
    using std::cout;
    using std::endl;
    
    class Solution {
    public:
        vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
            // Some code
        }
    };
    
    int main() {
        Solution sol; // Create an object named sol from the class Solution
        vector<int> nums = {2, 7, 11, 15}; // Input for the function
        int target = 9; // Target for the function
        vector<int> result = sol.twoSum(nums, target);
        
        // Do something with result
        for (int i = 0; i < result.size(); i++) {
            cout << result[i] << " ";
        }
    
        return 0;
    }
    ```

2. **Compile and Run:**
    ```sh
    g++ main.cpp -o main && ./main
    ```

**Note:**  
Outputs in the code will be shown in the test cases output area. Ensure to **remove print statements** before submitting, as they can affect performance metrics (LeetCode measures execution time).

**Example with Print Statement:**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        cout << "hello";
        return vector<int>{2}; 
    }
};
```

- **Run Result:**
  ![Test Area]({{/assets/image-21.png| relative_url}})

### üü¢ Python

#### üìù Function Signature Example

For the same question [Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum), the Python function signature appears as:

![Python Function]({{/assets/image-23.png| relative_url}})

```python
class Solution(object):
    def twoSum(self, nums, target):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :type target: int
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
```

**Explanation:**
- **Object-Oriented:** The function is part of a class.
- **Simplified Setup:** No need to write `main()`, import statements, or handle namespaces.

#### üõ†Ô∏è Running Locally (Python)

To run the code in your local environment:

1. **Create `main.py`:**

    ```python
    class Solution(object):
        def twoSum(self, nums, target):
            """
            :type nums: List[int]
            :type target: int
            :rtype: List[int]
            """
            # Write your solution here
            # No need for main function, includes, or namespace std
            # Example of just returning [0, 1]
            return [0, 1]
    
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        sol = Solution()
        nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]
        target = 9
        result = sol.twoSum(nums, target)
        print(result)
    ```

2. **Run the Script:**
    ```sh
    python main.py
    ```

**Note:**  
Outputs in the code will be shown in the test cases output area. Ensure to **remove print statements** before submitting, as they can affect performance metrics (LeetCode measures execution time).

**Example with Print Statement:**

```python
class Solution(object):
    def twoSum(self, nums, target):
        print("hello")
        return [0, 1]
```

- **Run Result:**
  ![Python Test]({{/assets/image-24.png| relative_url}})
